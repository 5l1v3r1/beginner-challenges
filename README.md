# beginner-challenges

These are some challenges for people who are getting into programming and want small challenges to learn with. Each challenge has its own directory with an accompanying README file.

I am creating these for a specific person, but anybody is free to use them. Feel free to make pull requests or file issues if you discover any problems or have any suggestions.
